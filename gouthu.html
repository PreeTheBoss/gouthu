		Gouthu , I don't know , I am seriously missing you so much , I am going crazy .I was in college , even though I knew you wouldn't come to college my eyes kept looking for you , they were waiting to see you ,I couldn't stay without seeing you . I was watching videos on youtube , randomly very randomly , the way you smile , that damn smile was flashing in my mind , I started missing you more , I am dying to see that smile again on your face .I started to cry I dont know why .I am scared to lose you even though I know you are gonna stay with me no matter what , even though I know you will be with me , I am scared to lose you . I am  scared where u will stop loving me I guess , idk this is a new feeling I guess , I am not sure of this feeling . I love you ra gouthu .I seriously do . I am scared to let go of you ra .I want to hug you for a really long time without u pushing me back even if I am crying , just let me hug for a really long time .I am really sorry for everything that happened . I just love you , I am ready to change for you , I want you to be happy and I will do anything to make you stay happy .When you smile you look nice , and when I know that I am the reason for your smile , thats enough for this lifetime ra chitti. Even though we dint break-up , even though I know this isnt a breakup , the distance between us is killing me , this is more worse than a breakup .I have you but you arent with me , this is the worst feeling ever

			Its been more than 31hrs since you texted ,or called ,or seen your face , I am not able to stay at home , feeling breathlessness , I am trying to divert myself so much just that I can stop thinking of you , but whereever I go , whatever I do , I keep thinking of you , whatever I see , almost everything reminds me of you , even when I went out with parents on their anniversary , mom was sitting next to me , it reminded me of us , when we went out on your ethnic day , I almost started to cry missing you , I controlled , I want you with me everyday , everytime , everywhere . The only way this can happen is when we get married , so please marry me soon ?I can't lose you kaney , I seriously cant , I never felt all this ever in my life ra , I never wanted anyone in my life this much .Your love towards me is way too much and I dont wanna lose this ever in my life .I am sitting with so many people around me , still I feel kinda incomplete or whatever , I am not happy ra ,I may smile but thats not from my heart . this was the same feeling before I met you on Saturday , Saturday morning when I saw your face , thats when I started to smile from my heart .I am very dependant on you .Even if you go away from me for 2 mins , even if you say 2mins I ll be back , I miss you , I wanna spend every second with you .I seriously do need you with me everytime.I told mom to give food , like mix curd and rice and give , I was the one who told her to get me, but when I went to eat , I couldn't eat kaney , I dont know why ,I couldn't eat , I had to force myself to eat . When you were writing my name on the railway track ,it made me very emotional .Nobody ever did this , nobody ever cut their hand for me .Even now when I think about it ,I feel emotional ,it makes me cry, anyway Goodnight ,Take care , I love you .

    		I have hurted you a lot , dont I deserve to get hurt back too ?Its fine ,I deserve everything you do to me .I completely deserve .I know , karma is a boomerang .I seriously loved you ,I still love you,I will always love you, even the smallest thing ,you sending heart to another guy also hurts me , but I deserve all this for hurting you noe , atleast a see you instead of a bye ? I dont know , I deserve all of this .it's fine , I will wait , I will wait till you get confidence or whatever it is , I will wait till you trust me again completely , I will wait till you believe me again completely , and I won't break that trust ever again ,ever. I dont know how to care .Everytime when you or someone talks about caring ,I feel very uncomfortable ,I dont know why ,I am sorry for not caring you as much as others do. The first time I felt this was , when Aishwarya or someone was telling you that one of her friend cares for her a lot .When a friend is caring for her so much ,me being a boyfriend ,I am not caring as much as a friend does. Second time was when you told Chethan went searching for a chocolate , just to find a chocolate with "I love you" written on it , I felt waste .The way u told this was like u were expecting that much of love from me , I failed to give you , I am sorry .I don't know what to do.You felt Nithin as your back support and you sent a heart to him , sending a heart to him din't make me cry , me failing to be your back support made me cry .Its fine ,its all my fault and I am a waste so yeah. I will always be there with you from now as I always did, as I said until u feel like believing me or completely trust or feel that I am making use of the last chance that you gave me ,you can be like this,You can do whatever you want ,I feel waste even till today ,till now .There were situations before , where I felt waste , I still feel waste . I don't know , when was the other times I felt waste , anyway I am a waste I know so yeah .....I am sorry for everything , I am trying to become a better person ,hope you stay and help me in this process of changing me .I hope I become one and become your's completely again ...
